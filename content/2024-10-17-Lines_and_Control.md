Don't hold the brush like a ball point pen.<br> 
Hold it right at its end.<br>
Hold it with two fingers.<br>
Hold it away from your body.<br>
<br>
<br>
Draw a line.<br>
Draw it, where it goes.<br>
Let go of controlling it.<br> 
Only to gain it again, to let it go.<br> 
<br>
<br>
Let the control flow.<br> 
Back and forth.<br>
