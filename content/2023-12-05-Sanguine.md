Sanguine or red chalk is a mineral pigment made of clay and hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). It is deep red in color and has been used for artistic expression already by the neanderthals. Since the renaissance it has been shaped into a kind of pencil, used mainly for sketches similar to graphite pencils today.

The goal is to build a framework for generative art for pen plotters in Rust.

Some features I have in mind:

- generate art as svg
- parse a limited number of shapes from svg files (WIP).
- add more organic ways to generate images, such as Voronoi diagrams.
- experiment with L-systems.
- add camera input, so the generated art can be a reaction to what already is on paper.
- project layout that allows for easy transitions between creating art work with lots of predefined functions, writing custom parts for the frame work and switching between different works of art.
- generate art without svg output, by addressing the pen plotter directly.
- input from hardware RNGs.

You can also follow the project over at [github](https://github.com/Mirabellensaft/sanguine). Output that I do consider art will also be posted at [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tanks_transfeld/).
