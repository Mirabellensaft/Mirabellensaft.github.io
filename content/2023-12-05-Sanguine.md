Sanguine or red chalk is a mineral pigment made of clay and hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). It is deep red in color and has been used for artistic expression already by the neanderthals. Since the renaissance it has been shaped into a kind of pencil, used mainly for sketches similar to graphite pencils today.

The goal is to build a framework for generative art for pen plotters in Rust.
